# UMEQAM — Deterministic Risk & Decision Core

UMEQAM is a **conceptual, deterministic decision-support core** designed to surface
risk, uncertainty, and structural imbalance in complex situations.

This repository is **not** a machine learning model and **not** an automation system.
It does not predict outcomes or replace human judgment.

---

## What this is

UMEQAM is:
- a deterministic decision-support core
- a tool for reducing false confidence
- a reference implementation of risk-aware reasoning
- explainable by design

The same input will always produce the same output.

---

## What this is NOT

UMEQAM is **not**:
- a predictive model
- an AI agent
- an automated decision-maker
- a production-ready product

It is a **thinking tool**, not a solution.

---

## Why it exists

Many failures in strategy, operations, and planning happen not because of
missing data, but because of:
- ignored uncertainty
- structural imbalance
- overconfidence in weak signals

UMEQAM exists to make these risks explicit before a decision is taken.

---

## Typical use case

You are deciding whether to proceed with an action under uncertainty.

Input:
- confidence in available information
- stability of the situation
- level of uncertainty or imbalance

Output:
- a risk-adjusted decision signal
- a transparent explanation of why risk dominates or not

Final decisions remain with a human.

## Design principles

- Deterministic logic only
- No learning, no adaptation
- No hidden state
- Full explainability
- Fail-safe by design

---

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.
It is published as a **reference and thinking aid**, not as a maintained product.

Use it as inspiration, not as an authority.
